    The type attribute tells the browser that the script should be treated as a JavaScript module. 
    It indicates that the script is using ES6 modules.
    Modules are loaded asynchronously by default, meaning they don’t block the rest of the page from loading while 
    they’re being fetched.
    They also have strict mode by default (meaning some features that could cause errors are not allowed).
